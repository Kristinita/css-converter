PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CONFIGURATION

It looked like that until now:

{
  "css_converter_indent": 2,
  "css_converter_semicolon": ":",
  "css_converter_eol": "",
}

Now the format looks like this:

{
  "indent": 2,
  "colon": true,
  "eol": ""
}

Changes:
  1. There are no prefixes in options.
  2. semicolon is now colon (it was a typo)
  3. colon option has a boolean type (it is enabled or not)
  4. colon option works just for stylus. For sass colon will always be there
