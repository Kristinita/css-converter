Thank you for installing the plugin!

Please write issues on github if you have any ideas for improvement the plugin.

You can easy configure plugin with the next settings:

{
  "indent": 2,
  "colon": true,
  "eol": "",
}

Default hotkey is "ctrl + v", but you could change it to another:

[
  { "keys": ["ctrl+v"], "command": "css_to_sass" },
]
